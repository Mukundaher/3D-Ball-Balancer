## üìå Overview 

  ball-balancing **3-RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical)** Platform. It can dynamically balance a ball in real time and perform motion tasks such as moving in straight lines, quadrants, and even circles. The robot uses real-time computer vision, inverse kinematics, and PID control for its operation.

## üßÆ Inverse Kinematics [(Snippets)]([https://github.com/Mukundaher/3D-Ball-Balancer/blob/main/Inverse_kinematics.pdf])

We derived and implemented the IK for the 3-RRS platform to calculate the exact servo angles required to achieve desired platform tilt and height. This allowed precise control over the ball's motion.

## üëÅÔ∏è Ball Detection with OpenCV

- HSV Trackbar for color tuning
- Faster response than BGR and no noise Like Grayscale ,for robust tracking 
- `cv2.findContours` and `cv2.minEnclosingCircle` to detect the ball
- Real-time position and area returned for control logic

---

## üéõÔ∏è PID Tuning

after manual tuning and testing, a finely tuned PID controller was implemented, keeping the ball at centre.

## üìê CAD Files [(Link)](https://github.com/Mukundaher/3D-Ball-Balancer/blob/main/STL_Files.zip)

All the 3D models used in this project‚Äîincluding the base, platform, servo holders, and linkages‚Äîwere custom-designed using Fusion360. You can find the .stl files in the  STLs directory. These files are ready for 3d printing.
